## The catalogue

### Heatwaves: [Improving Land Surface Temperature (LST) Maps Using Night-time Images](./Heatwaves_NewDataSource)

In the CLIMAAX Heatwave Risk Assessment Workflow, satellite-based LST images as the exposure component are analysed. The workflow currently defines the Landsat 8 image downloading methodology and related codes. However, since daytime land surface temperatures often exceed 60°C and are distributed relatively homogeneously across the city center, it was not possible to effectively visualize temperature variations or the urban heat island effect. Therefore, as joint working group from Mersin and Şanlıurfa Metropolitan Municipalities, we searched for another data source providing night-time LST images. This is not 'yet' a complete workflow that can be run directly. As the initial step, we'd like to share our approach.
